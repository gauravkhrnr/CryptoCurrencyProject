## Supported exchanges

Gekko is able to directly communicate with the APIs of a number of exchanges. However communication with some exchanges is somewhat limited. Gekko makes the distinction between the following features:

- Monitoring: Gekko is able to retrieve live market data from the exchange. Gekko can store and run trading simulations over this data.
- Live Trading: Gekko is able to automatically execute orders (based on the signals of your strategy). This turns Gekko into a trading bot.
- Importing: Gekko is able to retrieve historical market data. This way you can easily get a month of market data over which you can [backtest](../features/backtesting.md) your strategy.
